Hi, I’m Morten
I’m 36 years old, based in Copenhagen, and currently studying Datamatiker while transitioning into software development.

## Background

I spent over 20 years working in professional kitchens, where I progressed from chef to kitchen leader, managing teams, planning workflows, and keeping operations running under pressure. Working in different kitchens taught me structure, discipline, and the importance of clear communication — skills that translate surprisingly well into software development.

Most recently, I worked at Microsoft, where my interest in technology turned into a clear goal: to move into software development. Being close to engineers and modern systems opened my eyes to how much the mindset from kitchen work overlaps with writing good software.

## From Kitchen to Code

Many principles from the kitchen world mirror those in software development:
- Everything has its place — organization matters
- Clean processes prevent errors
- Teamwork and communication are essential
- Preparation and structure enable creativity

These ideas now guide how I approach coding, system design, and learning new technologies.

## What I’m Working On

As a Datamatiker student, I focus on:
- Backend development
- Frontend development
- Databases and system design
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Building real-world projects and documenting the process

This site is where I share projects, and echnical blog posts as I grow into my role as a developer.
